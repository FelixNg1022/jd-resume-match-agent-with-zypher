## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Deno**:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**:

   **Groq (Recommended - Free & Fast)**
   
   Uses LLaMA (Meta's open-source LLM) with Groq's high-performance inference API.

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk-your-groq-api-key-here"
   export GROQ_MODEL="llama-3.1-8b-instant"  # Optional - defaults to LLaMA 3.1 8B Instant
   ```

   Get your key: <https://console.groq.com/keys>

   **Tavily (For Job Search)**

   ```bash
   export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-key"
   ```

   Get your key: <https://tavily.com>

   **OpenAI (Alternative)**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
   export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"  # Optional - defaults to gpt-4o-mini
   ```

   Get your key: <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

   > **Note:** Groq is recommended for development (free tier available). OpenAI is used as a fallback if Groq API key is not configured. Tavily is optional—without it, the app uses mock data for demonstration.

### Running the Application

```bash
deno task run:server
```

Open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

> **Note:** The interface features a futuristic dark mode design with prominent animated gradients, glowing effects, and modern AI aesthetics. It's fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The design includes dynamic gradient animations, shimmer effects on text, glowing borders, scanline overlays, and sophisticated glassmorphism effects for a cutting-edge user experience.

### Usage Flow

1. **Add your resume** (required) - You can either:
   - **Paste your resume text** directly into the textarea, or
   - **Upload a PDF file** using the "📄 Upload PDF" button (text will be automatically extracted)
2. **Option A - Analysis Mode:** Paste a job description and click "Analyze Match" to get:
   - Fit score with matched/missing skills breakdown
   - Personalized improvement suggestions
   - Results displayed in "📊 Analysis Results" section
   - Job search section appears automatically after analysis
3. **Option B - Search Mode:** Leave JD empty and click "🔍 Search Jobs" to:
   - Enter role, location, and keywords (all optional)
   - Get top 3 matching jobs ranked by fit score
   - View detailed match analysis for each position
   - Results displayed in "🔍 Job Search Results" section

**Note:** Both analysis and job search results can be displayed simultaneously, allowing you to compare and reference both sets of results at the same time.

```

### Technology Stack

**Core Framework**

- **Zypher** (`@corespeed/zypher`) - CoreSpeed's AI agent framework
- **LLaMA** (Meta's open-source LLM) - Large language model for intelligent analysis (via Groq)
- **Groq API** - High-performance inference provider for LLaMA (fast, free tier available, recommended)
- **OpenAI API** - Alternative LLM provider (fallback if Groq is not configured)
- **Tavily API** - AI-optimized web search with content extraction

**Runtime & Language**

- **Deno** - Modern TypeScript runtime
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **RxJS** (`rxjs-for-await`) - Reactive event streams

**Additional Libraries**

- **pdf-parse** - PDF text extraction for resume uploads

### How It Works

1. **Resume Input**
   - Users can paste resume text or upload a PDF file
   - PDF files are automatically parsed to extract text content
   - Extracted text is populated into the resume textarea

2. **Agent Initialization**
   - Creates Zypher context and initializes model provider
   - Uses LLaMA (Meta's open-source LLM) via Groq inference API for fast, cost-effective analysis
   - Falls back to OpenAI if Groq API key is not configured
   - Configures streaming support for real-time responses

3. **Analysis Pipeline**
   - Structured prompt engineering for consistent JSON output
   - Streaming response processing with event accumulation
   - Post-processing: filters non-technical terms, validates skill matches, auto-corrects errors

4. **Job Discovery**
   - Tavily API searches web for relevant positions
   - Intelligent filtering by job board name (catches all domain variations: .com, .ca, .co.uk, etc.)
   - Automatically filters out 36+ job boards including LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Eluta, Levels.fyi, Workopolis, and more
   - AI analysis ranks top 3 matches by resume fit
   - Returns structured results with match breakdowns

5. **Resilience**
   - Automatic fallback to local keyword-based parser on API failures
   - Graceful degradation maintains core functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **API key not found** | Verify environment variable: `echo $GROQ_API_KEY` |
| **API quota exceeded** | App automatically uses fallback parser; check limits at <https://console.groq.com> |
| **Mock job data shown** | Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` for real job search results |
| **Port 8000 in use** | Use `PORT=9001 deno task run:server` or kill existing process |
| **Import errors** | Always use `deno task run:server` (includes proper config) |
| **Empty resume warning** | Resume field will highlight in red if empty; paste text or upload PDF |
| **PDF upload fails** | Ensure file is a valid PDF; check browser console for detailed errors |

## 📋 Important Notes

- **Default Behavior:** LLaMA (Meta's open-source LLM) via Groq inference API is used if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set; otherwise falls back to OpenAI
- **Skill Filtering:** Only technical skills are analyzed (benefits, salary, etc. are excluded)
- **Job Board Filtering:** Filters by job board name (e.g., "glassdoor") to catch all domain variations (.com, .ca, .co.uk, etc.)
- **Score Variance:** LLM probabilistic nature may cause ±3-5 point variations (expected behavior)
- **PDF Parsing:** PDF uploads extract all text content. Some formatting (tables, columns) may be simplified, but all text is preserved for analysis
- **Multiple Operations:** You can run multiple analyses or job searches - each new operation updates its respective results section
- **Simultaneous Results:** Analysis and job search results are displayed in separate sections and can be viewed simultaneously
